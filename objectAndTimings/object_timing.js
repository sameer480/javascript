const score=[85, 90, 95];// in javascript arrays are also objects
score.subject = "Math";// adding a non-integer property to the array
for(let key in score){

}
//Using setIntervalWrite a JavaScript program that uses setInterval to print the current second (0â€“59) every second. Stop the interval after 5 seconds using clearInterval.
let sec=0;
const intervalId= setInterval(()=>{
    console.log(sec);
    sec++;
    if(sec>5){
        clearInterval(intervalId)
    }
})
//Object Reference BehaviorCreate two objects item1 and item2 with identical properties name: "Apple". Assign item1 to item3 and modify a property in item3. Write code to demonstrate that item1 and item3 point to the same object, while item2 is different.
const item1={
    name:"apple"
}
console.log(item1.name);
const item2={
    name:"apple"}
console.log(item2.name);
const item3=item1;

console.log(item3.name);
item1==item3;
item1===item3;
item2==item3;
item2===item3;
//Nested Object ManipulationCreate an object company with a nested object address containing street, city, and zip. Write a function updateAddress that takes the company object and a new city value, updates the nested city property, and returns the updated object.
const company = {
    name: "TechCorp",
    address: {
        street: "123 Tech Lane",
